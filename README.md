# eulerian-path
Php project to find Eulerian path in graph

Computational complexity
------------------------
**v** - number of vertex

**e** - number of edges

Finding start point: v + e

Finding path: e

**v + 2e**

*Only operations on matrix are consider as important for Computational complexity*
